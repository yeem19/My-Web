For my web profolio I decided to make it more specific and tailor it to my next steps after college. 
I am currently in the process of applying to accelerated nursing programs and want to 
make my web profolio a show case of my application. Additionally, I want to provide 
information of what an acclerated nursing program is because when I first decided 
I wanted to do nursing, I was already well into my sophomore year at the University of Pittsburgh. 
I immediately thought that I was very behind and that there was no way I could catch up. After finding
out about the ABSN program, I felt it was perfect for me due to the fast-track aspect. 
SO FAR:
  I had no prior knowledge of how to code a website, html, or CSS, therefore this is a learning process. I am currently only finished with a small portion of my website and still need to use CSS to make it look more presentable. 
  My end goal of this website is to have three sections. A home page, an about page, and an application page. The about page will include information about the program and about me, specifically about why I chose this program.
  The application page will be more similar to everyone's web profolios because it will showcase what makes me a good candidate to be accepted into a nursing program.
