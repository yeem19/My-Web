  	<h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i> Get to know me!</i></p>
   <p class="w3-justify"> Hi, my name is Miranda Yee. I currently am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh. I will be graduating with a Psychology degree and economics minor in Spring 2023! I have always had an interest in nursing, but was never certain that I wanted to pursue it as a career until the end of my sophomore year. I felt that there was no way to catch up to the nursing students my age and that I would have to repeat college. Until I learned about accelerated BSN programs. I learned more and more about these programs and the thorough education along with the fast-tracked ciricullum ensured me that this would be a great option for me!
     </p>
     <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">Personal Statement</h3>
     <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i> -Why I want to be a nurse-</i></p>
     <p class="w3-justify"> Growing up I was always a bit more educated on the medical field than most kids. My parents were both in the health care systems and always told us their crazy stories of work experiences or their medical school horrors. I always found myself more interested than my sibilings in my parents' experiences in the hospitals. Beginning in sixth grade, my grandfather began having medical issues, strokes,complications from the strokes, diabetes, and heart issues. I was always concerned with his health and found myself always wanted to help him as much as I could from that age forward. It was never a chore or a burden to me and taking care of people always came naturally to me. My grandfather only spoke spanish so I was involved in a lot of his medical issues whether it was bringing him to his appointments or reading his pill or medical letters to him. Emergency hospital visits were always very frightening for me, however, I had a lot of respect for the nurses and could never express my gratitude to them for taking such good care of my grandfather. Every visit was a bit scary, but was always made a bit less scary knowing that he was in the hands of the nurses. Being exposed to that environment always made me want to do something related to helping people, but I was never sure that nursing was for me. As I went through college and heard about all the new things my nursing friends were learning and getting to do, I found that I was drawn to nursing. I quickly did more research on what the profession entailed and began a job as a patient care technician. As someone with no clinical experience, this was an intimidaitng job for me, but I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and embraced the fact that I would learn every shift what it takes to be a great nurse. Working on an oncology unit it has taught me a lot physically how to take care of a patient and emotionally how to deal with difficult situations. With oncology patients, you need to be prepared to deal with situations were there isn't always going to be a good outcome or an easy fix. Not only do you need to physically be able to take care of your patients, but you need to support them through a tough time. This job has taught me many things that I would never be able to learn from textbooks. I was surprised to find that the environment was so welcoming and it has made me even more excited to pursue a career in nursing.
